    <p>I am a student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute pursuing a dual major 
        in Computer Science and Mathematics, with a minor in Psychological Sciences. 
        I am particularly interested in the intersection of artificial intelligence 
        and quantitative finance, and I aim to apply advanced AI techniques to drive 
        innovation and gain a competitive edge in quantitative trading. </p>
    <p>With a strong foundation in technical problem-solving, hands-on experience in 
        software development, and well-developed interpersonal communication skills, 
        I bring both analytical rigor and collaborative energy to every project. I am 
        currently seeking internship opportunities where I can apply my skills in 
        real-world financial environments. </p>
    <p>I am also on track to graduate early, pending the evaluation of transfer and 
        advanced standing credits.</p>
